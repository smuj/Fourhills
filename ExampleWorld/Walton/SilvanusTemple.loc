##NAME:Silvanus's Temple
##PLAYLISTNAME:Temple
##DESCRIPTION
A temple to Silvanus, neutral god of Wild Nature and Druids.
It's a spacious stone building on the north side of the temple.

Worshippers protect nature from encroaching civilization; implacable foes of industrial people.
Riturals: entreaties for spells at sundown or in moonlight.

There are a couple of Silvanite clerics here and a few worshippers singing and reading.
