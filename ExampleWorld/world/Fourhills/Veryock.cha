##NAME:Veryock
##DESCRIPTION
Athletic figure
Friendly
In his early 20s
Jeweller
More well off than the commoners but not really middle-class.
He followed in the trade of his mother.
He has a friend in Ranbury - also a human, name of Igtan - who he grew up with. Happens to be a much younger brother of Igthin, the lowlife from The Kobold's Lantern.
The friend was gravely injured in a scuffle with some guards, and has ongoing trouble with his left leg.
Veryock takes a potion to him to relieve the pain and allow him to walk. The potion is worth 25gp and lasts a very long time - a little sip every day is enough. Each potion lasts 5-6 months before it is used up.
If Veryock can't make it to Ranbury to deliver the potion, he usually pays someone to take it to the barkeep. The barkeep then makes sure it gets to Igtan.

"So how did that potion delivery job go?"
"What? You forgot/got the wrong password?"
"You sold it on the black market!"
"Come with me to Ranbury to prove your innocence. We need to get another potion, just in case"
"No, I won't accept the money. This is most puzzling - if you stole the potion then why do you offer me the money?"
